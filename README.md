This started out as my attempt at the Calculator Project for The Odin Project:

Which started out okay, and I had the basic calculator functions down without issue, but I was really struggling with how to capture the input and calculate that in Javascript, so I bounced around to a few different video tutorials to maybe get some clues. Many of them used the eval() function which I wanted to avoid per the assignment, and I had already figured out the computational logic using a switch statement.

At this point through the Odin Project curriculum I have a pretty solid grasp on HTML and CSS, but Javascript and DOM manipulation is still fairly new to me, so I was really struggling with how to do that, should I use classes? Should I use IDs?

The tutorial I sended up following for this project was from Web Dev Simplified:

After browsing other students' projects I saw many using data attritubes but this tutorial does a good job explaining why. It makes sense to use data attributes for Javascript interaction and leave IDs and classes CSS for styling, as this allow you to more easily see what parts of the HTML is being used by whichever external element.

This, and other videos, also create the HTML barebones structure first, which makes sense, but will often try to completely finalize CSS styling before even getting to the Javascript. When starting from scratch on my own, I was so lost trying to get the Javascript hooked in I hadn't even styled anything outside of a few HTML elements like line breaks, which seems like a really poor practice. Moving forward I am going to prioritize the front end styling completion before actual JS scripting, of course dependent on the project needs.

Finally, thanks to this tutorial, I have been introduced to Javascript Classes for the first time, as well as plenty of use with the "this" keyword. Reading around on the internet there are some mixed feeling about using classes within Javascript, but this was a good learning experience nonetheless, and the logic for this use case made a lot of sense to me.

I do not quite have the same sense of accomplishment had I been able to complete this entirely on my own, but I did learn a lot throughout the process, including many times where I had to troubleshoot and debug my own code for simple things like typos. I am grateful for the wealth of resources available, and look forward to continuing my studies.

Update: keyboard controls added, but '/' button does not work properly in Firefox because of the quickfind keyboard shortcut, investigating alternatives...
